## Overview
This repository contains the Tableau visualization project for this week's Makeover Monday challenge. The project explores the distribution of Asian restaurants in the United States, focusing on the cuisines they serve, such as Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and others. The primary visualization is a **Voronoi chart** styled as a **serving plate** that depicts the percentage share of each cuisine.
